## How to Play

To start the game, click on a card. Timer will start. Pick another card. If the cards match, they will turn green and stay visible. If they do not match, the cards will turn red and then flip back over. Keep trying to make matches until all the cards are matched. A congratulations screen will appear with your total moves, total time and a star rating for the game. Click "Play Again" to start the fun all over.
